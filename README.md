This is my ICE Task

It takes in the number of scripts to be marked

the number of questions

the subtotal of each question

the number of lecturers


the application tries to divide the number of scripts evenly amoung teachers
and no teacher can have more than 50 students
this allows for even distribution to each lecturer even the last one which gets allocated the remaining scripts

The App also determines how long it will take each lecturer to mark all scripts
